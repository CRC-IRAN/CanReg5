This Would be a basic in introduction, the text in each section can be edit by editing the file:
<CanReg5 installation folder>\conf\tables\r\report_text\section_name.txt. 
(This will be moved to a user folder eventually...)

Here's an example:

My country is the nice and sweet, you can see funny animals sometimes.
People are getting old and happy, drinking soda, smoking cigarettes...
Cancer is coming as sure as winter! 

Plan A: Find a nice looking princess controlling giant dragons, and if possible a funny talkative imp. 
Plan B: Increase our knowledge about cancer.

Let's begin Plan B, in cases Plan A do no work.
